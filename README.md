This is a Twitter bot that uses the biorxiv API (via the [**biorrxiv** R package](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/biorrxiv)) and E-Utilities NCBI API (via the [**rentrez** R package](https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez)) to identify new publications from a set list of authors with associated institutional affiliations as describe on this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pj2ctCbk5YAkfM4WnpShu8vfLxj7qFsCZn6pz78JXzM/edit?usp=sharing). It then uses the [**rtweet** R package](https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet) to tweet out new publications from [@CuocoBot1](https://twitter.com/CuocoBot1).
